Which Oscar Winning Movie Should I Watch? 

Here's the scenario: 

It's Sunday night.  
Dinner? Eaten.  
Dishes? Done.
Meal-prep? Ready. 

You're ready to cap off a long week, collapse on the couch and watch Netflix. ... or Hulu, or Stan, or Amazon Prime ... You get the idea!

That's when it hits: Decision Fatigue. 

You scroll.  You swipe.  You look at trailer after trailer...

90 minutes later, you end up watching the same dumb movie you've seen a million times. 

If only there were a program out there to choose a movie for you that won't make you feel like you've wasted 2 hours of your life ...
